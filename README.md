This repository contains a Python data consolidation project that merges three separate Kaggle datasets of job postings from the United States, Canada, and India. The objective of the project was to standardize the structure of each dataset, clean and format the data using regular expressions and various Python and pandas methods, and create a unified file suitable for comparative labor market analysis.

The process involved harmonizing column names, aligning categorical variables, formatting salaries and job titles, handling missing values, removing noise, and restructuring the data to ensure consistency across all three regions. After standardization and thorough data cleaning, the datasets were concatenated into a single CSV file containing 11,205 rows. This project represents an end-to-end data engineering and wrangling workflow, from raw multi-source data to a clean integrated dataset ready for further analysis or dashboard creation.
